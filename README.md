# ByNightReference
A Quick Reference for LARPs


# See http://NashvilleUnveiled.com/a/ for the alpha of the Android app.

<p>Short and sweet: this is a single page quick reference for common pools, notably all Disciplines, used in the By Night Studios Vampire: the Masquerade.  It is designed as a tool for STs and players to unobtrusively check mechanics during scenes, but does not contain detailed descriptions (buy the book!).</p>

<p>Currently we only support Vampire the Masquerade, but will add an option for Werewolf and other systems as they are officially released.</p>
